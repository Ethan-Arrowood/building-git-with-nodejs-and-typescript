Initial revision of "jit", the information manager from Boston

This commit records a minimal set of functionality necessary for the code to store itself as a valid Git commit. This includes writing the following object types to the database:

- Blobs of ASCII text
- Trees containing a flat list of regular files
- Commits that contain a tree pointer, author info and message

These objects are written to `.git/objects`, compressed using zlib.

At this stage, there is no index and no `add` command; the `commit` command simply writes everything in the working tree to the database and commits it.
